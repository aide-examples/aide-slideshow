# AIDE - Slideshow

<img src="WallMonitor.png" style="float:right; max-width:30%; margin-left:20px; margin-bottom:10px;"/>

A modular fullscreen photo slideshow with a plugin architecture for different hardware setups.

Designed to run on a *Raspberry Zero* connected to a wall mounted display.

This project is part of [AIDE examples](https://github.com/aide-examples) - a series of applications built almost completely with agentic coding.

AIDE Slideshow contains a set of modules - *aide-frame* - which might be re-used in a different project.
